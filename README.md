# Rocket-launch
CG miniproject on openGL


The aim of this project entitled “Rocket launching Simulation“ is to build a graphics package using OpenGL technology & Microsoft Visual C++ as the platform for compilation. It deals with various implementations of OpenGL functions to render objects using primitives. It also demonstrates animating objects using transformation functions in OpenGL.
The scene consists of: 
An area which is suitable to build  an rocket
A space vehicle which is rendered using Basic primitives & it can be moved on pressing key manually using inbuilt timer.
